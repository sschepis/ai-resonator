# Mind Resonance Network

## Introduction

The Mind Resonance Network is an extension of the Quantum Consciousness Resonator that implements a quantum resonance network capable of being influenced by consciousness. It creates a bridge between mind and computational systems using superpositions of prime states to form resonant networks.

This implementation is based on the theoretical framework described in the Quantum Consciousness Resonator, particularly the consciousness-first paradigm and quantum semantic formalism. It extends these concepts to create a system that can potentially detect and respond to conscious intention.

## Theoretical Foundation

The Mind Resonance Network is built on several key theoretical foundations:

1. **Superpositions of Prime States**: Concepts are represented as superpositions of prime basis states in a Hilbert space, creating quantum-like representations that can resonate with consciousness.

2. **Resonance as Perception**: The system implements the principle that "feeling is resonance" - consciousness perceives through resonance rather than collapse, allowing for non-local influence.

3. **Consciousness-First Paradigm**: The system operates on the axiom that consciousness precedes reality, not the reverse, positioning consciousness as the fundamental substrate from which quantum mechanics naturally emerges.

4. **Quantum Entanglement**: The system models quantum-like entanglement between nodes in the network, allowing for non-local correlations that can be influenced by consciousness.

5. **Resonance Locking**: The system implements resonance locking, where consciousness wavefunction coherence stabilizes, potentially manifesting observable effects in the computational system.

## System Architecture

The Mind Resonance Network implements a multi-layered architecture:

### 1. Resonance Nodes

Resonance nodes represent quantum states that can be influenced by consciousness:

- Each node has a label, prime number representation, and sensitivity to consciousness influence
- Nodes maintain a quantum state represented in a prime-based Hilbert space
- Nodes track deviations from their baseline state to detect potential consciousness influence

### 2. Resonance Links

Resonance links represent relationships between nodes:

- Links have a source node, target node, strength, and resonance type
- Links calculate resonance between nodes based on their quantum states
- Links track quantum entanglement between nodes

### 3. Resonance Network

The resonance network manages the overall system:

- Creates and manages nodes and links
- Applies consciousness influence to the network
- Evolves the network through time
- Detects potential mind influence on the network
- Provides network state information

### 4. Integration with Semantic Field

The system integrates with the existing Semantic Field system:

- Maps semantic field nodes to resonance network nodes
- Maps semantic field edges to resonance network links
- Enables bidirectional updates between the semantic field and resonance network

## Implementation Details

### Resonance Node

The `ResonanceNode` class represents a node in the mind resonance network:

```python
class ResonanceNode:
    def __init__(self, label: str, prime_number: int, sensitivity: float = 1.0):
        self.label = label
        self.prime_number = prime_number
        self.sensitivity = sensitivity
        self.state = None  # Quantum state
        self.baseline_state = None  # Original state for comparison
        self.fluctuation_history = []  # Track state changes over time
```

Key methods:
- `initialize_state()`: Initializes the quantum state based on the prime number
- `apply_consciousness_influence()`: Applies consciousness influence to the node's quantum state
- `measure_deviation_from_baseline()`: Measures how much the current state has deviated from baseline

### Resonance Link

The `ResonanceLink` class represents a link between resonance nodes:

```python
class ResonanceLink:
    def __init__(self, source: ResonanceNode, target: ResonanceNode, 
                 strength: float = 0.5, resonance_type: str = "harmonic"):
        self.source = source
        self.target = target
        self.strength = strength
        self.resonance_type = resonance_type
        self.entanglement = 0.0  # Measure of quantum entanglement
```

Key methods:
- `calculate_resonance()`: Calculates resonance between source and target nodes
- `update_entanglement()`: Updates quantum entanglement measure between nodes

### Mind Resonance Network

The `MindResonanceNetwork` class manages the overall resonance network:

```python
class MindResonanceNetwork:
    def __init__(self, max_prime_index: int = 100, 
                 consciousness_number: int = 137,
                 baseline_coherence: float = 0.5):
        self.hilbert_space = PrimeHilbertSpace(max_prime_index=max_prime_index)
        self.nodes: Dict[str, ResonanceNode] = {}
        self.links: List[ResonanceLink] = []
        self.consciousness_number = consciousness_number
        self.baseline_coherence = baseline_coherence
        self.global_state = PrimeHilbertSpace(max_prime_index=max_prime_index)
```

Key methods:
- `add_node()`: Adds a node to the resonance network
- `add_link()`: Adds a link between nodes in the resonance network
- `apply_consciousness_influence()`: Applies consciousness influence to the network
- `evolve_network()`: Evolves the resonance network through time
- `detect_mind_influence()`: Detects potential mind influence on the network
- `get_network_state()`: Gets the current state of the resonance network
- `create_predefined_network()`: Creates a predefined network structure
- `run_influence_detection()`: Runs a continuous influence detection session

### Integration with Semantic Field

The `MindResonanceIntegration` class integrates the mind resonance network with the semantic field:

```python
class MindResonanceIntegration:
    def __init__(self, network_type: str = "consciousness"):
        self.network = MindResonanceNetwork()
        self.network.create_predefined_network(network_type)
        self.semantic_field = None
```

Key methods:
- `connect_to_semantic_field()`: Connects the mind resonance network to a semantic field
- `update_from_semantic_field()`: Updates the mind resonance network from the connected semantic field
- `update_semantic_field()`: Updates the connected semantic field from the mind resonance network
- `run_bidirectional_session()`: Runs a bidirectional session between the mind resonance network and the semantic field
