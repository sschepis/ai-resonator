Sebastian Schepis

## Introduction to Quantum-Like Computation on Classical Systems

Classical systems, by nature, lack inherent quantum superposition, entanglement, and non-locality—traits that form the core of quantum computation. However, by encoding information using prime-based wave functions and carefully structuring arithmetic relationships through p-adic quantum mechanics and quantum group structures, we can simulate and enhance quantum behaviors on classical computers. This framework leverages number theory, statistical properties of prime numbers, and advanced mathematical structures to enable quantum-like operations, offering classical systems a new computational paradigm that incorporates interference, phase accumulation, spectral analysis, and topological protection.

## 1. Prime-Based Quantum State Space as a Computational Foundation

### 1.1 Enhanced Prime-Encoded Wave Functions

The fundamental wave function:
```
ψn(x) = N(n)^(-1/2) ∑k cos(2πkx/n)exp(-|k|x/n)
```
encodes each integer as a unique state. This representation maps integers onto wave functions that mimic quantum states, where:
- n represents a discrete, computationally meaningful "quantum" number
- x is a continuous parameter enabling wave-like behavior
- N(n) ensures normalization

Enhanced through quantum group structure:
```
ψq,n(x) = N(n,q)^(-1/2) ∑k αk(q)cos(2πkx/n)exp(-|k|x/n) ⊗ R
```
where:
- q is the quantum deformation parameter
- R is the quantum group R-matrix
- αk(q) includes quantum corrections

Key Equivalencies and Insights:

1. Enhanced Amplitude Structure:
```
|ψq,n(x)|² represents both:
- Probability densities
- Quantum group-enhanced statistical measures
- Topological invariants
```

2. Advanced Frequency and Multiplicative Structure:
```

```

### 1.2 Enhanced Prime State Construction and Phase Information

Expanding on prime states, each prime is now represented by:
```
|p⟩ = N(p)^(-1/2) ∑k exp(-k²/2p)exp(2πikθp)|k⟩ ⊗ R(q)

where:
- θp encodes prime-specific phase information
- R(q) is the quantum group correction
- q is the deformation parameter
```

```

Controlled operations now include:
```
1. Quantum group-enhanced rotations:
   Rq(θ) = exp(iθH) ⊗ R

2. Mirror symmetric phase shifts:
   Φ(p,q) = M(exp(iθp)) ⊗ R

3. Topologically protected transformations:
   T(p) = exp(2πiω(p)) where ω(p) is a topological invariant
```

### 2.2 Enhanced Quantum Gate Operations
